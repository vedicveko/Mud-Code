Taint Fluid - Thief poisoning skill

This is a skill used mainly toward pkill on Dibrova, but can be used
for mobs as well. It allows a thief that is carrying a liquid container
that is poisoned to slip that poison into someone else's canteen,
virtually undetected.

As it works now, this code only allows drink containers to be poisoned
but there is no reason why fountains and/or other objs that might
contain liquids can't be added.

So - here it is:


*In spells.h, define your skill:
(taint fluid was the 100th skill added to Dibrova, your number might
 be less than that depending how many skills you've already added to
 your mud)
#define SKILL_TAINT_FLUID           100 /* Thief skill to poison liquids    */


*In class.c, give thieves the skill (change the level if you like):
 abil_level(ABT_SKILL, SKILL_TAINT_FLUID, CLASS_THIEF, 105);


*In spell_parser.c, add your skillo:
 (just look for 'End of skills')
+  "taint fluid",
/* End of skills */
  "\n"
}; 


*In interpreter.c, add do_taint to the command interpreter:
ACMD(do_taint);

  { "taint"    , POS_STANDING, do_taint    , 0, 0 },


*In act.item.c, the meat 'n' potatoes of the skill:
ACMD(do_taint)
