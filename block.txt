To use this BLOCK skill, go to fight.c and in the "damage" function,
before it actually does the damage, flee, etc, put the following...

  /* For BLOCK */
  if (GET_POS(victim)==POS_FIGHTING) {
    if (GET_SKILL(victim, SKILL_BLOCK)) {
      if (number(1, 640) <
         GET_SKILL(victim, SKILL_BLOCK)+(2*(GET_DEX(victim)-GET_DEX(ch)))) {
        act("You block $N's vicious attack!", FALSE, victim, 0, ch, TO_CHAR);
        act("$n blocks your vicious attack!", FALSE, victim, 0, ch, TO_VICT);
        act("$n blocks $N's vicious attack!", FALSE, victim, 0, ch, TO_ROOM);
        return;
      }
    }
  }


The numbers are arbitrary, really.  They seem to work well in the
context of Dibrova but you may need to make adjustments.  Like all
skills, add the skill name and a skillo in spell_parser.c.  Then, 
go to class.c and link it to a class.  Since this skill activates
itself, you don't need to add a new command.
