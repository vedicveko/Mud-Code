Here's my implementation of the OMNI command.  I say that like I'm 
totally comfortable with it.   The fact is, I never heard of it until
recently when an immortal on my MUD mentioned it.  It doesn't make
much difference to have this command, really.  I use it to just get a 
quick idea what and how everyone is doing.  This will sometimes 
lead me to use another custom command I have called FLUX.

Anyway, it basically lists all the mortals and tells you how healthy
they are, where they are, what position they are in (fighting, resting,
etc.) and a few other unimportant things.

To plug this in your CircleMUD, just plop the following function in
act.wazard.c...

ACMD(do_omni) {

  struct char_data *tch;
  char tmp[256];
  int count = 0;

  send_to_char("Lvl  Class  Room   Name                "
               "Health  Position\r\n", ch);
  for (tch = character_list; tch; tch = tch->next)
    if (!IS_NPC(tch) && GET_LEVEL(tch) < LVL_IMMORT) {
      sprintf(tmp, "%2d  %4s    %-5d  %-20s  %3d%%  %s\r\n",
              GET_LEVEL(tch), CLASS_ABBR(tch), world[IN_ROOM(tch)].number,
              GET_NAME(tch), (int)(GET_HIT(tch)*100)/GET_MAX_HIT(tch),
              position_types[(int)GET_POS(tch)]);
      send_to_char(tmp, ch);
      count++;
    }
  if (!count)
    send_to_char("  No mortals are on!\r\n", ch);

}

...and then add the declaration and command to interpreter.c, like:

ACMD(do_omni);

...and...

  { "omni"     , POS_DEAD    , do_omni     , LVL_ADMIN, 0},
