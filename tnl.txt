TNL - a handy little command that simply reports how much experience
you need to gain another level.  See, on Dibrova, we make players go
to a guild and GAIN.  When you have enough experience (a negative 
amount to the next level) you stop gaining experience, so it's a good
thing to high-tail it back to a town and GAIN.  Anyway, just add do_tnl 
to act.informative.c and then a new line to the command list for "tnl",
recompile and rock on.  Like a hurricane, I mean.


ACMD(do_tnl)
{

  char tmp[256];

  if (GET_LEVEL(ch) >= LVL_IMMORT) {
    send_to_char("You are all leveled out!\r\n", ch);
    return;
  }

  if ((level_exp(GET_CLASS(ch), GET_LEVEL(ch) + 1) - GET_EXP(ch)) < 1 ) {
    act("$n is ready to gain another level!", FALSE, ch, 0, 0, TO_ROOM);
    act("You are ready to gain another level!", FALSE, ch, 0, 0, TO_CHAR);
  } else {
    sprintf(tmp, "$n needs %d to gain another level.", level_exp(GET_CLASS(ch),
               GET_LEVEL(ch) + 1) - GET_EXP(ch));
    act(tmp, FALSE, ch, 0, 0, TO_ROOM);
    sprintf(tmp, "You need %d to gain another level.", level_exp(GET_CLASS(ch),
               GET_LEVEL(ch) + 1) - GET_EXP(ch));
    act(tmp, FALSE, ch, 0, 0, TO_CHAR);
  }
}
