This file contains the spec_procs for the thieven temple.

kaan_altar is meant to be assigned to the robed priest.  This spec
requires a new command to be added to the interpreter command list
called "Kneel".  When you add kneel to the list, set it's function
to "do_not_here" and that'll be fine.

The thieven_maze proc is assigned to the rooms of the maze that
link to various "random" spots on the game.
