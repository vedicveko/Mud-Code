Here's a good use for LUCK, have a mob spare the player from death if he
"lucks" out. 

In fight.c

After:

  /* stop someone from fighting if they're stunned or worse */
  if ((GET_POS(victim) <= POS_STUNNED) && (FIGHTING(victim) != NULL))
    stop_fighting(victim);

Add: 

  if ((GET_HIT(victim) <= 10) && (GET_POS(victim) >= POS_STUNNED) && (FIGHTING(v
ictim) != NULL) && (IS_NPC(ch)) && (GET_LUCK(victim) > number(15, 2000))) {


 act("$N walks away. It must be your lucky day!", FALSE, victim, 0, ch, TO_CHAR)
;
 act("$N stops fighting and walks away. It must be $n's lucky day!", FALSE, vict
im, 0, ch, TO_NOTVICT);
 stop_fighting(victim);
 stop_fighting(ch);


  }
