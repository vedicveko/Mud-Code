The following skill is as implemented as the ranger skill on
Dibrova.  Edit the following "#defines" to point to the vnums
of the critters you want players to be able to summon on your
mud.  Remember - there's a progression here.  Some animals will
be harder to summon than others.

Because this is a skill, you will need to link it to a new
command (defined in interpreter.c) to get it hooked up.  Then,
add the skill to a class in "class.c" so players can use it.
Like all other skills, you'll need to update the table in 
spell_parser as well as plugging its skillo.
